Finished all parts, probing with double hash didn't work as 
intended as there were an incorrect amount of collisions.

I didn't understand the compiler warnings and the
double hashes were colliding more than intended.

To compile program:
    make all
To run individual cases:
    make run1quadratic
    make run1linear
    make run1double
    make run2short
    make run2

Sample input files:
    document1_short.txt
    document1.txt
    query_words.txt
    words.txt
    wordsEn.txt
