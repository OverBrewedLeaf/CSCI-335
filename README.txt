Finished  tasks 1 and 2a-b

I ran into issues attempting to trace through the contains function
and finding a way to return total calls from functions like remove

To run program:
    make clean
    make all
    ./query_tree <databasefilename> <tree-type>
    ./test_tree <databasefilename> <queryfilename> <tree-type>
    ./test_tree_mod <databasefilename> <queryfilename> <tree-type>

Sample input files:
    sequences.txt
    rebase210.txt
