Finished Part 1. 2 is incomplete, probing with double hash didn't work as intended

I didn't understand the compiler warnings and the
double hashes were colliding more than intended.

To run program:
    make all
    make run1quadratic
    make run1linear
    make run1double

Sample input files:
    document1_short.txt
    document1.txt
    query_words.txt
    words.txt
    wordsEn.txt
