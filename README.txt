Finished only creating the graph and finding Adjacent Queries.

Finding Paths did not work as intended and couldn't find a solution

To compile program:
    make all
To run individual cases:
    ./CreateGraphAndTest Graph1.txt AdjacencyQueries1.txt
    ./CreateGraphAndTest Graph1.txt AdjacencyQueries1.txt
    ./FindPaths Graph1.txt (intended destination)

Sample input files:
    Graph1.txt
    Graph2.txt
    AdjacencyQueries1.txt
    AdjacencyQueries2.txt
